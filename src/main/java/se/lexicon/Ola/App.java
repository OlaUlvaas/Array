/**
 *                       Week2 - Java Arrays - Excersises
 *
 *   1.Write a program which will store elements in an array of type 'int' and print it out.
 *     Expected output:11 23 39 etc.
 *
 *   2.Create a program and create a method with name 'indexOf' which will find and return the index
 *     of an element in the array. If the element doesn't exist your method should return -1 as value.
 *     Expected output:Index position of number 5 is: 2.
 *
 *   3.Write a program which will sort string array.
 *     Expected output:String array: [Paris, London, New York, Stockholm]
 *     Sort string array: [London, New York, Paris, Stockholm]
 *
 *   4.Write a program which will copy the elements of one array into another array.
 *     Expected output:Elements from first array: 1 15 20 Elements from second array: 1 15 20
 *
 *   5.Create a two-dimensional string array [2][2].
 *     Assign values to the 2d array containing any Country and City.
 *     Expected output: France Paris Sweden Stockholm
 *
 *   6.Write a program which will set up an array to hold the next values in this order: 43, 5, 23, 17, 2, 14
 *     and print the average of these 6 numbers.Expected output:Average is: 17.3
 *
 *   7.Write a program which will set up an array to hold 10 numbers and print out only the uneven numbers.
 *     Expected output:Array: 1 2 4 7 912Odd Array: 1 7 9
 *
 *   8.Write a program which will remove the duplicate elements of a given array
 *     [20, 20, 40, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 50].
 *     Expected output:Array: 20 20 40 20 30 40 50 60 50 Array without duplicate values: 20 40 30 50 60
 *
 *   9.Write a method which will add elements in an array.
 *     Remember that arrays are fixed in size so you need to come up with a solution to "expand" the array.
 *
 *   10.Write a program which will represent multiplication table stored in multidimensional array.
 *   Hint: You have two-dimensional array with values [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]]
 *
 *   11.Write a program that ask the user for an integer and repeat that question until user give
 *   you a specific value that user already has been told about as a message in your program.
 *   Store these values in an array and print that array. After that reverse the array elements so that
 *   the first element becomes the last element, the second element becomes the second to last element, etc.
 *   Do not just reverse the orderin which they are printed.
 *   You need to change the way they are stored in the array.
 *
 *   12.Write a program which will print the diagonal elements of two-dimensional array. Expected output:1 4 9
 *
 *   13.Create two arrays with arbitrary size and fill one with random numbers.
 *   Then copy over the numbers from the array with random numbers so that the even numbers are located in the rear
 *   (the right side) part of the array and the odd numbers are located in the front part (the left side).
